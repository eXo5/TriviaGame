Trivial Chase Psuedo --

HTML will be simple. A title, a timer below the title, and a div to take up a rectangle in the middle of the page that will get $("div").html("Each Question")

Change the background color of the div when the question changes.

Place a header on the page that will $("chaseQuest").html for each new question. 
	4 radio buttons for potential answers. One .btn for a submit button. 
		function checkRightAnswer() = if/else for right or wrong answer.
			after setTimeout 5000 present next question.

All of the above will occur within 120 seconds. 120000ms
